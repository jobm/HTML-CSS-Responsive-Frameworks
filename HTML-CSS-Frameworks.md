#HTML CSS Frameworks
HTML has some responsive frameworks that enable web application developers to create Mobile first web application allowing them to concertrate on the layout rather than the responsivness of the application.
In the past developers had to build a desktop website and a moblie website due to lack of responsive frameworks.

HTML CSS frameworks are pre-prepared software frameworks that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and unobtrusive. This differentiates these from functional and full JavaScript frameworks.

##Examples of HTML Responsive Frameworks
* Bootstrap
* Foundation 
* Materialize Css

There are many other frameworks but the above mentionned are the most used or atleast as far as i know, we will talk about bootstrap in this write up.

##What is Bootstrap according to Wikipedia
Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. It aims to ease the development of dynamic websites and web applications.

Bootstrap is a front end framework, that is, an interface for the user, unlike the server-side code which resides on the "back end" or server.

Bootstrap is the most-starred project on GitHub, with over 85,000 stars and more than 34,000 forks.

##How Bootsrap works
Bootstrap is written in JavaSrcript and HTML/CSS thus making it easy to intergrate into a project, it predefines css styling that Web developers can add to components to make them look good and responsive accross all screen sizes.
Bootstrap also uses a 12 grid column responsive system that enable user to place content according to screen size thus avoiding to write their own JS to make their web applicaions responsive.
Example of a website using Bootstrap:

##The CSS

Bootstrap provides a set of stylesheets that provide basic style definitions for all key HTML components. These provide a uniform, modern appearance for formatting text, tables and form elements.

##Re-usable components

In addition to the regular HTML elements, Bootstrap contains other commonly used interface elements. These include buttons with advanced features (e.g. grouping of buttons or buttons with drop-down option, make and navigation lists, horizontal and vertical tabs, navigation, breadcrumb navigation, pagination, etc.), labels, advanced typographic capabilities, thumbnails, warning messages and a progress bar. The components are implemented as CSS classes, which must be applied to certain HTML elements in a page.

##JavaScript components

Bootstrap comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields. In version 2.0, the following JavaScript plugins are supported: Modal, Dropdown, Scrollspy, Tab, Tooltip, Popover, Alert, Button, Collapse, Carousel and Typeahead.


#JavaScript Frameworks
JS has frameworks that make it easier to develop front end solutions, this frameworks also enable JS programmer to write a less amount of code and also be able to build Single Page Applications or Model View Controller applications.

##Examples of JavaScript Frameworks.
* Angular JS
* Backbone JS
* React JS
* Polymer JS
* Knockout JS
And many more others
