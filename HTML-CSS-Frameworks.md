#HTML CSS Frameworsk
HTML has some responsive frameworks that enable web application developers to create Mobile first web application allowing them to concertrate on the layout rather than the responsivness of the application.
In the past developers had to build a desktop website and a moblie website due to lack of responsive frameworks.

HTML CSS frameworks are pre-prepared software frameworks that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and unobtrusive. This differentiates these from functional and full JavaScript frameworks.

##Examples of HTML Responsive Frameworks
* Bootstrap
* Foundation 
* Materialize Css

There are many other frameworks but the above mentionned are the most used or atleast as far as i know, we will talk about bootstrap in this write up.
